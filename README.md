Is there life without ORM?
====================================

Sometimes it's worth not to use certain tool just to understand the value
it brings to you. So, the goal of this repo is to demonstrate how you could
live without ORM (Doctrine ORM in my case).

Note: This repo also includes some of the ideas I have in mind, and 
I will continue to work on this repo as a playground for my experiments.
